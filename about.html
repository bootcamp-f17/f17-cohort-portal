	<p>I guess it's better to be lucky than good. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? How long can two people talk about nothing? We have a saboteur aboard. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?</p>

	<h3>Class Life</h3>
	<p>Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. The unexpected is our normal routine. How long can two people talk about nothing? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.</p>
