	<p>is an American sketch comedy television series that is a spin-off of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! starring John C. Reilly as Dr. Steve Brule. The series premiered on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, on May 16, 2010. The program follows Brule as he examines different facets of living.

As the series progresses, he reveals shocking and sometimes horrifying details about his past and personal life.</p>
